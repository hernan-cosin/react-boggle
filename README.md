# Boggle Board

## React web app

This is a reproduction of boggle board with english dice distribution.

Build with React, TypScript and Styled-components as ui styling framework.

I wanted to recreate the random behavior of the Boggle game. So every time
you hit the shuffle button a function is called to get a random number for 
the dice face and then another one to get the random position of the dice 
on the board.
